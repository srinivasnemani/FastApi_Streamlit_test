"""
    This package contains scripts for testing the application of API endpoints and option pricing logic.
    
    This package provides test cases for the B76OptionPricer and OptionPricer classes, which are part of 
     b76_model and api.option_pricer modules respectively. 
     
     It validates the correctness of the calculate_option_prices and 
     calculate_market_prices methods for these classes. Mock data is provided through the 
     MockDataPersistence_Call and MockDataPersistence_Put classes for testing purpose.
